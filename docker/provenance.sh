# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS IS FOR, IN ONE SENTENCE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A tag is a mutable name, so an image pulled as `:e2e` cannot say which commit
# is inside it; this stamps the image so that the thing running can name what
# it was built from, and so that the name is CHECKABLE rather than decorative.
#
# It is the second half of P3-19 (one artifact, every environment). That packet
# moved every e2e tier onto a pulled image, which was correct and left this hole:
# a consumer that pulls cannot tell whether the bytes contain the fix merged
# five minutes ago or the one before it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE FORMAT, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Four places were available. Measured, not assumed:
#
#   1. OCI image LABELS (what this does). `docker image inspect` reads them off
#      a PULLED image with the tool every consumer in this fleet already runs,
#      and they survive `docker pull` with no buildx, no network round trip and
#      no extra binary. Verified on both the label path and the file path:
#        $ docker image inspect stampprobe:2 --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}'
#        {"org.opencontainers.image.revision":"0123…4567", …}
#      Cost: they are metadata, so a `--no-cache` rebuild changes them — but so
#      does any other stamp, and they are the only sink that is BOTH readable by
#      the consumer and impossible to forget, because they live in the
#      Dockerfile every build path goes through.
#
#   2. A buildx PROVENANCE ATTESTATION. `provenance: mode=max` is already on in
#      `.github/workflows/image.reusable.yml`, so an attestation exists for
#      images built by that workflow — and it is the wrong answer for a
#      CONSUMER. Reading one is `docker buildx imagetools inspect` or
#      `docker attestation verify`, both of which fetch a REFERREER from the
#      registry over the network; the e2e tier pulls from a plain-HTTP registry
#      on `localhost:16010` and a referrer fetch against that is a second thing
#      to configure. Worse, an attestation is attached by the WORKFLOW, and the
#      e2e artifacts are pushed by `bin/e2e-stack publish-siblings` with a bare
#      `docker build`. The stamp would be absent exactly where this packet needs
#      it most. Kept on, still — it costs one manifest entry — but not counted.
#
#   3. An OCI ANNOTATION on the manifest list. Same reachability problem as (2),
#      and worse: annotations sit on the INDEX, not on the per-platform config,
#      so `docker image inspect` does not show them at all.
#
#   4. A MANIFEST BESIDE THE IMAGE — a second object in the registry holding
#      {tag, sha256, commit}. Rejected outright: it is a join between two
#      independently mutable things, so "the registry and the source disagree"
#      becomes a state you cannot detect. This packet's whole point is that the
#      stamp must be ABLE TO DISAGREE VISIBLY, and a side manifest is the one
#      shape where it cannot.
#
# And a fifth, which is a sink rather than a format, and is also here:
#
#   5. A FILE IN THE IMAGE (`/app/kit-provenance.json`). Labels live in the
#      image CONFIG, which a running process cannot reach — there is no docker
#      socket, no CLI, and in several of these images no shell. So "the thing
#      running can name what it was built from" is FALSE for labels alone. The
#      file is derived from the same validated fields by the same script, and
#      `tests/provenance_test.sh` asserts the two SINKS AGREE, which is what
#      stops the file from becoming a second, hand-editable lie.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE FIVE FIELDS, AND WHY EXACTLY FIVE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   source            org.opencontainers.image.source      owner/repo
#   revision          org.opencontainers.image.revision    40 hex
#   built_at          org.opencontainers.image.created     RFC3339 UTC
#   source_dirty      com.cafaye.kit.source.dirty          clean|dirty
#   template_version  com.cafaye.kit.template.version      vN.N.N
#
# Three are standard OCI keys, so a tool that knows nothing about cafaye reads
# them. Two are kit's own namespace, which is the whole of the private surface.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, because each was tempting:
#   - the BRANCH. A branch is a moving name: stamping one reintroduces exactly
#     the ambiguity the stamp removes, and `type=ref,event=branch` already
#     publishes it as a TAG where a human wants it.
#   - the dirty FILE LIST. `source_dirty` is a flag. Which paths were dirty is a
#     developer's working state and, on this fleet, a local absolute path.
#   - the BUILDER'S HOSTNAME / the runner. It is infrastructure identity, it
#     outlives the artifact's meaning, and on the e2e path it is a laptop.
#   - a VERSION of the software. kit's header already argues this in the
#     workflow: a release tag is a claim, and cutting one is a decision.
#   - `unknown` as an acceptable value for `source` and `revision`. It IS
#     accepted (an unstamped local build must not be refused), but `verify`
#     treats it as a FAILURE when an expectation was given — which is the only
#     honest reading of "I do not know what this is" in an assertion.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REDACTION AT THE IO BOUNDARY — HOW, NOT A LIST OF BANNED WORDS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These images are pulled by anything with registry access, so the stamp is a
# PUBLICATION SURFACE. The rule is therefore a CLOSED GRAMMAR, not a denylist:
#
#     A value may be stamped if and only if it matches the exact shape of the
#     field it is being stamped into. There is no escape hatch, no "extra"
#     field, and no way to add a field without writing its shape — which is what
#     makes this structural rather than a list somebody has to remember to
#     extend when they add the next field.
#
# Measured consequences, each refused BY SHAPE and not by keyword (a keyword
# denylist is what gitleaks is, and what lets the next novel shape through):
#
#   kaka@cafaye.com            an email. No grammar in the set admits `@`.
#   a branch name              ASYMMETRIC, and stated rather than papered over.
#                              `worker/kit-provenance-01` is shape-IDENTICAL to
#                              `owner/repo`, so no grammar can refuse it in the
#                              `source` field — there is no regex that separates
#                              a repository from a branch with two segments and a
#                              hyphen. It IS refused in every other field
#                              (`revision` is 40-hex, `built_at` is RFC3339), and
#                              that is the whole of the defence. It is also not a
#                              leak: the registry publishes that string as a
#                              TAG already (`type=ref,event=branch`), to everyone
#                              with pull access, which is exactly the population
#                              that can read the stamp. The shapes that DO leak —
#                              local paths, emails, hostnames, credentials — are
#                              all refused, and the rule is therefore not "no
#                              secret is stamped" but the sharper one: **nothing
#                              is stamped that the registry reader did not
#                              already have.**
#   /Users/kaka/Code/any/moon   a local path. `source` requires exactly two
#                              `[a-z0-9._-]` segments; this has six and starts
#                              at `/`.
#   pg.corp.internal:5432      an internal hostname. `source` carries NO scheme
#                              and NO host — that is the point of the grammar,
#                              and it is why `https://github.corp/x` is refused
#                              too.
#   ghp_16C7…                  a credential. Not hex-40, not two path segments.
#
# The `source` grammar deserves the emphasis: **it admits exactly one `/`.**
# That single character budget is what makes "owner/repo" expressible and every
# path, URL and hostname above inexpressible, and it is why the host is not
# merely omitted from the format but STRUCTURALLY ABSENT from it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SUBCOMMANDS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   stamp --validate        read the fields from the environment, exit non-zero
#                           on the first field whose value is not its shape.
#   stamp --args            print the `--build-arg` lines a builder hands to
#                           `docker build`. Runs validation FIRST, so a builder
#                           cannot pass an unvalidated value into the image.
#   stamp --write FILE      write the JSON stamp. Runs inside the build (a
#                           Dockerfile RUN), with the same fields.
#   stamp --verify IMAGE    CONSUMER SIDE. Read the stamp off a PULLED image
#                           and print it; with `--expect-revision SHA` also
#                           ASSERT it, and exit non-zero when it disagrees.
#
# `--verify` is the answer to "a stamp nothing reads is a label on a picture".
# It is what `bin/e2e-stack` calls after it pulls, and it is the smallest
# consumer change in the fleet: two lines, one of them the print.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS IS A TEMPLATE AND NOT A LIBRARY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Services adopt kit by COPYING. So this file multiplies seven-fold across the
# Dockerfiles and then once per adopting repository, and it must stay small and
# boring: POSIX `sh`, no dependencies, no `bash`, no `pipefail` (it runs inside
# a `python:*-slim`, an `oven/bun:*-slim` and a `debian:*-slim` — the same
# argument `docker/entrypoint.sh` makes in its own header), and no network.

# THE FOUR VERDICTS, and why they are four and not two
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Before this revision `--verify` had exactly one failure mode that mattered:
# `[ -n "$expect_rev" ] || return 0`, so with no expectation it returned 0 for
# whatever the labels said — including Bun's, inherited from a base image. The
# codes are now four DISTINCT answers and none of them is 0 by accident:
#
#   0  the stamp is well-shaped, it is OURS, and every expectation given was met
#   4  the image carries NO labels at all. Unchanged, and LOAD-BEARING.
#   5  an expectation the CALLER GAVE was not met (`--expect-revision`,
#      `--expect-source`, or an `unknown`/absent answer to one)
#   6  the labels are present and are NOT a valid cafaye stamp: a field violates
#      its own grammar, a field that identifies the build is absent, or the
#      stamp carries nothing in kit's own namespace
#
# 4 AND 6 ARE NOT COLLAPSED, and a successor must not collapse them: something
# upstream depends on telling "this image was built without the stamp" (an image
# from before the packet) apart from "this image carries somebody else's stamp"
# (an image whose provenance is unknown and must not be trusted as ours). A
# caller that only tests `!= 0` still works; a caller that tests `== 4` still

  # `https://github.com/oven-sh/bun` — two slashes over a budget of exactly one,
  # a scheme, a host, a port, five separate violations of a grammar this file
  # already wrote down — came to be printed here as though it were our own.
  #
  # A redaction rule that exists only at stamp time is not a rule about the
  # stamp; it is a rule about the moment of writing, and a PULLED image does not
  # pass through that moment.

      # defensible basis: the script already says `unknown` is "the honest 'I do
      # not know what this is'" and that in an ASSERTION it is a failure.

      # The other three carry METADATA rather than identity, so an absent one is

  # makes the defect impossible by default rather than by a caller remembering.
  #
  # `org.opencontainers.image.*` is the STANDARD half of the format and every
  # published base image sets it — `oven/bun` sets source, revision and created,
  # and an image built `FROM oven/bun` carries them whether or not anybody built
  # it. `com.cafaye.kit.*` is kit's OWN namespace, and a base image cannot supply
  # it by accident. So the ABSENCE of kit's namespace is evidence of
  # non-authorship, and its presence is evidence of nothing in particular: anyone
  # who wants to forge a label can, and a format cannot defend against that. The
  # honest claim is the negative one, and it is the one that is load-bearing —
  # the defect this packet fixes is INHERITANCE, which this cannot miss.
  #
  # AT LEAST ONE kit key, not both. The question is "did kit's build write
  # this?", and one value in the private namespace answers it; requiring both
  # would be a second copy of `tests/provenance_test.sh` part B's five-key
  # agreement check, and a check that is a copy of another check goes red twice
  # for one cause. Measured: this is the branch `cafaye/guard:e2e` takes.

  # ASSERTION and a mismatch is exit 5; that is the case a perfectly well-formed
  # foreign source (`oven-sh/bun`, no scheme, two clean segments — which passes
  # every grammar in this file) can only be caught by.
  #
  # NOT GIVEN IS A WARNING AND NOT A FAILURE, and this overrules the packet's
  # recommendation to fail loudly. The reason is exit-code cost, stated plainly
  # rather than assumed: exit 4 is already load-bearing for "no labels at all",
  # so the cost of a new mandatory failure here is that every printing-form
  # caller written by kit's own FIRST MOVE — `provenance.sh --verify IMG || true`
  # in `parlor/bin/e2e-stack` and `site/bin/e2e-stack` — would print a FAIL and
  # continue, which is WORSE than a warning: it teaches a reader that this line
  # is noisy. A check that cries wolf on a green tree is not obeyed on a red one.
  #
  # What the recommendation asked for is not lost, only made impossible to
  # ignore: the warning names the source, says in words that ownership was NOT
  # established, and names the flag that would establish it. Half one above still
  # fails the run without the flag, so the defect that motivated the
